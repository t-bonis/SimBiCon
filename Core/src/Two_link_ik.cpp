/**
All quantities that are passed in as parameters here need to be expressed in the same "global" coordinate frame, unless otherwise noted:
- p1: this is the location of the origin of the parent link
- p2: this is the target location of the end effector on the child link
- n: this is the default normal to the rotation plane (it will get modified as little as possible to account for the target location)

- vParent: vector from parent origin to child origin, expressed in parent coordinates
- nParent: this is the rotation axis, expressed in parent coordinates. The relative arb_orientation between child and parent will be about this axis
- vChild: vector from child origin, to position of the end effector, expressed in child coordinates

Output:
- qP: relative arb_orientation of parent, relative to "global" coordinate frame
- qC: relative arb_orientation of child, relative to the parent coordinate frame


NOTE: for now, the vector vChild is pretty much ignored. Only its length is taken into account. The axis that the child is lined up around is the same as the direction
of the vector from the parent's origin to the child's origin (when there is zero relative arb_orientation between the two, the axis has the same coordinates in both
child and parent frame).
